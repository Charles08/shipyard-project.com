Shipyard provides cluster wide image management.  In the images view, you can
see details on all images across all Swarm nodes.  It also shows information
such as when the image was created, what node it resides and the size of the
image.  You can filter using the search feature.  Shipyard also provides the
ability to remove an image if needed.
