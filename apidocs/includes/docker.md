In addition to the Shipyard API, Shipyard also provides full compatibility for the Docker Remote API.  You can use the Docker Remote API for container operations such as create, start, stop and more.  Shipyard will pass any request to the Docker Remote API to Swarm.  See the [Docker Remote API Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/docker_remote_api/#docker-remote-api) for full reference.
